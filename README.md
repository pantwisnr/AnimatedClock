"# Animated Clock" 
- Creating an Animated clock using html,css and js 
- I am using Sass Css in this project
- In order to make sure the Saas has the right path to the index.html, css, and js files, you have to change the savePath in the settings under the formats setting.

- the following path is the correct way to get the Saas working since all the necessary files are inside the dist folder.
- {
   "format":"expanded",
   "extensionName":".css",
   "savePath":"/dist/css"
}
